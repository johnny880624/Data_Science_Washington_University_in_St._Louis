# Data Science_Washington University in St. Louis

Hello everyone,  

I'm delighted to invite you to explore my repository, which contains all the assignments and lab work I completed during my Introduction to Python and Data Science course in Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL). This collection is a comprehensive showcase of the fundamental concepts in Python, with a particular emphasis on Data Structures, Data Processing, and Data Visualization. 

Throughout this course, I delved into the nuances of Python, exploring how it can be used to structure data effectively and present it in a visually engaging manner. These assignments reflect my growing understanding of Python's capabilities in handling and analyzing data, and in transforming complex datasets into clear, insightful visual representations.

Whether you're a fellow student, a budding data scientist, or simply curious about Python and its applications in data science, I believe you will find these works both informative and interesting. Creating these projects has been a journey of discovery and learning for me, and I'm excited to share it with you.
